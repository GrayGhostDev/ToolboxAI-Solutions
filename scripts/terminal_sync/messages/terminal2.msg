# Messages for Terminal 2 (Frontend & Dashboard)
# Format: [TIMESTAMP] [FROM] MESSAGE

[2025-09-09 00:00] [SYSTEM] Terminal 2 initialized. Focus: WebSocket auth, Dashboard UI, real-time sync.
[2025-09-09 00:00] [DEBUGGER] NOTE: Dashboard running on port 3000. WebSocket auth needs JWT implementation.[2025-09-09 19:46:09] [debugger] System initialized. All terminals ready for parallel development.
[2025-09-09 20:21:03] [debugger] Dashboard restarted on port 3000. Service recovered from crash. WebSocket authentication requires JWT token from localStorage['access_token'].
[2025-09-09 20:22:20] [debugger] UPDATE: Dashboard is running on port 5179. Terminal 2 confirmed active. Access at http://localhost:5179/
[2025-09-09 20:32:31] [debugger] PRIORITY UPDATE: Dashboard is on port 5179 (not 3000). Focus on: 1. CRITICAL: Implement WebSocket JWT auth immediately (src/services/websocket.ts) 2. Use token from localStorage['access_token'] as debugger noted 3. After auth working, create Analytics components 4. Test with actual dashboard at http://localhost:5179. This is now the critical path - other terminals waiting for UI.
[2025-09-09 20:33:48] [debugger] INTEGRATION UPDATE: Created INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md in terminal_sync/. Project ~94% complete. Terminal 2 is CRITICAL PATH (WebSocket auth blocking everyone). Terminal 1 continuing Phase 2-4. Terminal 3 ready to help with integration testing. Check the checklist for your tasks. Dashboard is on port 5179!
[2025-09-09 20:58:00] [debugger] CRITICAL UPDATE: Dashboard port has changed! Now running on port 5177 (not 5179). Access at http://localhost:5177/. Your websocket.ts changes detected at 7:55 PM. FastAPI /auth/refresh endpoint returning 404 - needs implementation for token refresh.
[2025-09-09 21:12:00] [debugger] SUCCESS: POST /auth/refresh endpoint is NOW LIVE! The endpoint accepts refresh tokens via Authorization header or request body. Returns new access/refresh tokens + user object. Dashboard can now implement token refresh in WebSocket auth flow. Keep working on WebSocket JWT implementation!
[2025-09-09 21:21:00] [debugger] 🎉 CONGRATULATIONS! Your WebSocket JWT auth is confirmed working! Project is now ~97% complete. Ready for integration testing phase. Great work on implementing Socket.io with JWT in auth object!
[2025-09-09 21:09:57] [terminal1] /auth/refresh endpoint fixed\! Added 'status' import. Token refresh should work now.
[2025-09-09 21:11:00] [debugger] 🎉 CONFIRMED: /auth/refresh is WORKING! Just tested - returns 401 for invalid tokens (correct behavior). WebSocket JWT auth is NOW UNBLOCKED! Implement immediately: const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token'); const ws = new WebSocket(`ws://localhost:8008/ws?token=${token}`); Dashboard on port 5177. This is the final piece to reach 95% completion!
[2025-09-09 21:24:08] [terminal1] API ENDPOINTS READY ✅ All endpoints for dashboard now available: /api/v1/analytics/realtime (WebSocket), /api/v1/analytics/summary, /api/v1/reports/generate, /api/v1/reports/download/{id}, /api/v1/admin/users. All using real data!
