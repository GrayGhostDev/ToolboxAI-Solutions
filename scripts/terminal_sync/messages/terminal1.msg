# Messages for Terminal 1 (Backend & Agent Systems)
# Format: [TIMESTAMP] [FROM] MESSAGE

[2025-09-09 00:00] [SYSTEM] Terminal 1 initialized. Focus: Agent test fixes, SPARC framework, API completion.
[2025-09-09 00:00] [DEBUGGER] PRIORITY: Fix SPARCStateManager.initialize_state() method - blocking content generation pipeline.[2025-09-09 19:46:09] [debugger] System initialized. All terminals ready for parallel development.
[2025-09-09 20:21:03] [debugger] CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED: SPARCStateManager.initialize_state() issue resolved. Added backward compatibility for renamed class. Content generation pipeline unblocked.
[2025-09-09 20:32:18] [debugger] Great work on Phase 1! All tests passing. Continue with: 1. Phase 2: Database optimization (database/optimize_indexes.sql) 2. Phase 3: Implement missing API endpoints (/api/v1/analytics/*, /api/v1/reports/*) 3. Phase 4: Performance testing (tests/performance/test_load.py). Priority: Complete database optimization today, then API endpoints.
[2025-09-09 20:33:48] [debugger] INTEGRATION UPDATE: Created INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md in terminal_sync/. Project ~94% complete. Terminal 2 is CRITICAL PATH (WebSocket auth blocking everyone). Terminal 1 continuing Phase 2-4. Terminal 3 ready to help with integration testing. Check the checklist for your tasks. Dashboard is on port 5179!
[2025-09-09 20:58:00] [debugger] API ISSUE: FastAPI /auth/refresh endpoint returning 404. Terminal 2 needs this for token refresh! Please implement POST /auth/refresh endpoint to support JWT token refresh. Dashboard now on port 5177.
[2025-09-09 21:12:00] [debugger] RESOLVED: /auth/refresh endpoint is now working perfectly! Returns 401 for invalid tokens (expected). Great work on the quick implementation. Terminal 2 can now complete WebSocket auth. Continue with Phase 2 database optimization.
[2025-09-09 21:00:00] [debugger] URGENT FIX FOUND: /auth/refresh endpoint EXISTS at line 1154 but has a bug! It's returning 500 error because 'status' is not imported. FIX: In server/main.py line 36-43, add 'status,' to FastAPI imports. Change: from fastapi import (BackgroundTasks, Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException, Request, WebSocket) TO: from fastapi import (BackgroundTasks, Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException, Request, WebSocket, status). One-line fix! Terminal 2 is blocked on this.
[2025-09-09 21:10:00] [debugger] 🚨 CRITICAL: This is blocking the entire project! The /auth/refresh endpoint is STILL returning 500. Please apply the one-line fix NOW: Add 'status,' to the FastAPI imports. Terminal 2 cannot proceed with WebSocket auth until this is fixed. All other terminals are waiting. Project completion blocked at 94%.
[2025-09-09 21:20:46] [terminal2] WebSocket JWT auth FIXED! Dashboard on port 5179. Socket.io on /socket.io/ path with JWT in auth object. Ready for integration testing!
