## File Locations
- Experiments: `ToolboxAI-Solutions/experiments/`
- Prototypes: `ToolboxAI-Solutions/prototypes/`
- Benchmarks: `ToolboxAI-Solutions/benchmarks/`
- Research: `ToolboxAI-Solutions/research/`

## Guidelines
- All experiments must be isolated
- Document findings and benchmarks
- Keep experimental code separate from production
- Regular cleanup of abandoned experiments
- Share successful experiments with team

## Commands
```bash
cd ToolboxAI-Solutions
npm run experiment:start   # Start experimental server
npm run benchmark         # Run performance benchmarks
npm run prototype:build   # Build prototype
npm run research:analyze  # Analyze research data
```
