- Are completion/status reports for finished work
- Are outdated guides or documentation
- Contain historical reference value but clutter active directories

## Retrieval

If you need to retrieve archived files:
1. Locate the appropriate date directory
2. Copy files back to their original locations (see git history for context)
3. Update as needed for current project state

## Retention

Archives are maintained indefinitely in version control. They provide:
- Historical context for project decisions
