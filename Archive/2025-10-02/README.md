# Archive - October 2, 2025

## Purpose
This archive contains files removed during the filesystem cleanup and organization project. All files have been safely preserved before removal from their original locations.

## Contents

### Agent Logs
- `AGENT_RESTART_LOG.md` - Log of agent restart on October 2, 2025
- `AGENT_STATUS_UPDATE.md` - Status update for agents after restart

## Reason for Archival
These files were moved to maintain a clean root directory structure as per the documented organization standards in CLAUDE.md. The root directory should contain only essential configuration files (< 20 items).

## Safety Note
All archived files are preserved in git history and can be restored if needed:
```bash
# To restore a file from archive
cp Archive/2025-10-02/path/to/file /original/location/

# To view file history
git log -- Archive/2025-10-02/
```
