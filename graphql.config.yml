# This file configures the GraphQL Code Generator (https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen).
# It introspects the backend GraphQL schema and generates TypeScript types and
# React hooks for the frontend application.

# The schema is fetched directly from the running backend's GraphQL endpoint.
# Make sure the backend server is running before executing the codegen script.
schema: http://localhost:8009/graphql

# The documents (queries, mutations, subscriptions) are located in the frontend's source code.
