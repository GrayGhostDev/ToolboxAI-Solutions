## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. Fix bypass mode implementation in components
2. Ensure mock data is available for all routes
3. Fix WebGL context initialization
4. Update RoleGuard to work with bypass mode

### Component Updates Required
1. **DashboardHome**: Add mock data fallback
2. **Classes**: Fix data loading
3. **Reports**: Fix template loading
4. **Settings**: Fix page rendering
5. **3D Components**: Fix WebGL initialization

### Testing Improvements
1. Add retry logic for flaky tests
2. Increase timeout for slow-loading pages
3. Add better error messages
4. Create visual regression tests

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Development Team
1. **Priority 1**: Fix bypass mode in all components
2. **Priority 2**: Ensure mock data is comprehensive
3. **Priority 3**: Fix 3D rendering issues
4. **Priority 4**: Optimize performance

### For QA Team
1. Run tests with `--headed` flag to see visual issues
2. Check browser console for specific errors
3. Test individual components in isolation
4. Create component-specific test suites
