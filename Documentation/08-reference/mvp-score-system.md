# MVP Score System

## Overview

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Score System quantifies the readiness of our educational platform's core features. This scoring system helps prioritize development efforts, track progress, and ensure the platform meets minimum requirements for launch.

## Scoring Methodology

Each feature is evaluated across five key dimensions:

1. **Functionality (F)** - Does the feature work as expected?
2. **User Experience (UX)** - Is the feature intuitive and pleasant to use?
3. **Integration (I)** - Does the feature properly connect with other system components?
4. **Performance (P)** - Does the feature operate efficiently without degrading system performance?
5. **Testing (T)** - Has the feature been thoroughly tested for bugs and edge cases?

Each dimension is scored on a scale of 0-5:
- **0**: Not implemented
- **1**: Barely functional prototype
- **2**: Basic implementation with significant issues
- **3**: Functional implementation with minor issues
- **4**: Solid implementation meeting requirements
- **5**: Polished implementation exceeding requirements

## Core Features & Current Scores

| Feature | F | UX | I | P | T | Average | Notes |
|---------|---|----|----|---|---|---------|-------|
| **Navigation System** | 4 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 3 | **3.6** | Mobile responsiveness needs refinement |
| **Lesson System** | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | **3.0** | Rich media support incomplete |
| **Quiz System** | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 2 | **3.2** | Limited question types, needs more testing |
| **Gamification** | 3 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 2 | **3.0** | Achievement triggers need integration work |
| **User Authentication** | 4 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | **3.8** | Solid implementation with good security |
| **Student Dashboard** | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 2 | **3.0** | Data visualization needs improvement |
| **Educator Dashboard** | 3 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 1 | **2.2** | Analytics features incomplete |
| **Accessibility** | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 2 | **2.2** | Keyboard navigation and screen reader support lacking |
| **Progress Tracking** | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | **2.8** | Data persistence needs work |

## Overall MVP Readiness

**Overall Score: 3.0** (Average of all feature scores)

### Launch Criteria
- **Minimum Score Required for Beta Launch**: 3.0
- **Minimum Score Required for Public Launch**: 3.5

### Critical Path Items

The following items must reach a minimum score of 3.5 before launch:
1. User Authentication
2. Navigation System
3. Lesson System
4. Quiz System

## Recent Progress

| Feature | Previous Score | Current Score | Improvement |
|---------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Navigation System | 3.2 | 3.6 | +0.4 |
| Lesson System | 2.6 | 3.0 | +0.4 |
| Quiz System | 2.8 | 3.2 | +0.4 |
| User Authentication | 3.5 | 3.8 | +0.3 |

## Scoring History

| Date | Overall Score | Major Improvements |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| 2023-11-15 | 2.1 | Initial MVP assessment |
| 2023-12-15 | 2.4 | Authentication and Navigation improvements |
| 2024-01-15 | 2.7 | Quiz system enhancements, performance optimization |
| 2024-02-15 | 3.0 | Lesson system improvements, accessibility updates |

## Next Steps

To improve the overall MVP score, development efforts should focus on:

1. **Educator Dashboard** (Current: 2.2)
   - Complete core analytics features
   - Implement grade management system

2. **Accessibility** (Current: 2.2)
   - Improve keyboard navigation
   - Add screen reader compatibility
   - Implement color contrast options

3. **Progress Tracking** (Current: 2.8)
   - Enhance data persistence
   - Implement progress recovery mechanisms
   - Complete synchronization between devices

4. **Gamification** (Current: 3.0)
   - Finish achievement trigger integration
   - Complete reward redemption system
   - Implement leaderboard functionality

## Evaluation Process

1. The development team conducts a self-assessment biweekly
2. The product owner reviews and adjusts scores monthly
3. User testing feedback is incorporated into scores
4. The steering committee reviews the MVP score quarterly

## Score Improvement Strategy

For features below the target threshold:
1. Identify the lowest scoring dimension
2. Create specific, actionable tasks to address deficiencies
3. Prioritize these tasks in the sprint planning
4. Re-evaluate after implementation

## Conclusion

The current MVP score of 3.0 indicates that the educational platform meets the minimum criteria for beta release. While several components are approaching target quality levels, focused work is needed on the Educator Dashboard and Accessibility features to reach our public launch target of 3.5.
